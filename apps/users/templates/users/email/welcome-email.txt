Project management is a critical part of successful product design. There are nearly an infinite number of effective project management tools in use today, but this tool has been designed specifically for your use in 2.009 this fall!

This tool will allow you to organize your team, store files, maintain a calendar, assign and track tasks, and view statistics of your progress throughout the semester. These features have been designed to accommodate fluid team structures over the course of 2.009.

We have pre-populated several important elements of this tool so it already has information relevant to you and your team. 

Welcome to 2.009!
